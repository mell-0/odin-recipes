    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 large seedless watermelon</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp liquid smoke</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp each salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Garnish: balsamic reduction, crumbled feta cheese, chopped fresh mint</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cut the watermelon in half lengthwise. Place flat side down, and cut 1 ½ inch wide slices. 
            Cut the largest rectangle possible from each of these slices. You should be able to get about 
            6 steaks from ½ of a watermelon.
        </li>
        <li>Pat each of the steaks dry with paper towels. If you have time, place them in the refrigerator 
            uncovered for 1 to 2 hours to dry out excess moisture. Give them a final pat right before preparing.</li>
        <li>
            Whisk together oil, liquid smoke, garlic, salt, and pepper. Liberally brush on both sides 
            of watermelon steaks.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly grease a large saute pan over low/medium. Gently slide each steak in, cooking for about 5 minutes on 
            each side. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook each side for one minute until lightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>Serve warm, topped with balsamic reduction, feta, and mint.</li>
    </ol>
