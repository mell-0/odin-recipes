    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        If you've been scrolling on TikTok these past few weeks, you might have heard "Happy Birthday Grimace," 
        as creators go wild faking comically horrific consequences after sipping on the new limited edition purple 
        milkshake. McDonald's has rolled out plenty of characters over the years, and Grimace is the latest one to 
        take the spotlight, with people flocking far and wide to get their hands on the now-iconic purple shake.
